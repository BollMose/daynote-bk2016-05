# I have a little nut tree
I had a little nut tree, Nothing would it bear,
But a silver nutmeg And a golden pear;

The King of Spain's daughter Came to visit me,
And all for the sake Of my little nut tree.

Her dress was made of crimson, Jet black was her hair,
She asked me for my nutmeg And my golden pear.

I said, "So fair a princess Never did I see,
I'll give you all the fruit From my little nut tree.

I don’t want to live in a world like this. I want to be able to touch a flower in bloom, and smell it. 
I want to be able to hug someone, and tell them I love them in person. 
I want to watch a sunset with a tear roll down my cheek. 
I want to be able to feel the breeze on my face, smell a sweet cooking smell, 
I want to feel connected in a human way. 
I don’t want to sit in a gray suit, and be told what’s cool, 
under an air-conditioned led illuminated hall of electronic devices tracking my every move, be human is to be free.

"I, Kobe Bryant...have decided to skip college and take my talents to the NBA." Kobe's announcement, 1996
"I set (the NBA) as a goal and now I'm here. I'm very confident in my choice. 
It's the opportunity of a lifetime. It's time for me to go out and seize it while I'm still young. 
It's a great challenge. I'm not thinking about being a superstar, taking all the shots. That's not me. 
I'm looking at trying to learn from the players. There's a lot they can teach me from the first player down to the 12th. 
I don't know if I can reach the stars or the moon, or whatever. 
If I fall off the cliff for the time being, so be it. I'll still be in there learning."
