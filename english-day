The Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 35, was written by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in 1878. 
It is one of the best known violin concertos, 
and is considered one of the most technically difficult works for the violin.
The piece is in three movements:
Allegro moderato (D major)
Canzonetta: Andante (G minor)
Finale: Allegro vivacissimo (D major)
There is no break or pause between the second and third movements.
A typical performance runs approximately 35 minutes.
