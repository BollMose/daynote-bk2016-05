Which of the following are good ways to resolve the conflits?

Please take a seat and tell me what's happened.
I dont know what went wrong, but let me try and straighten this out for you.

Don't worry. These things happen all the time in this office. You'll get used to it.
I am sorry. That should've been explained to you earlier.
Well, its not my fault. What do you expect me to do about it?
I dont know what you are talking about. I never agreed to that.

A: Why dont you sit down and tell me what's wrong?
B: This deadline I've got is ridiculous. There is no way I can get all of this done by Wednesday.
A: I am sorry to hear you feel that way. I understand your frustration. There's obviously a problem here.
Let me see what we can do about it right now. What else have you got on at that moment?
B: My main concern is not getting the end-of-month accounts finished on time.
A: Here is what I suggest we do. I will see if I can get someone from Accounts to help you with the end-of-month accounts. 
Will that work?
B: It's still going to be difficult because I had to spend last week covering for Bob's sick leave.
A: Ah yes, thanks for that. I know it was short notice. How about you stay late this week to get this done and 
I'll give you Moday off in lieu so you get a nice relaxing long weekend.
