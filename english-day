"I, Kobe Bryant...have decided to skip college and take my talents to the NBA." Kobe's announcement, 1996
"I set (the NBA) as a goal and now I'm here. I'm very confident in my choice. 
It's the opportunity of a lifetime. It's time for me to go out and seize it while I'm still young. 
It's a great challenge. I'm not thinking about being a superstar, taking all the shots. That's not me. 
I'm looking at trying to learn from the players. There's a lot they can teach me from the first player down to the 12th. 
I don't know if I can reach the stars or the moon, or whatever. 
If I fall off the cliff for the time being, so be it. I'll still be in there learning."
