This app is Great but needs a link to the full site
I Love the new look.
New look I love this new look. It makes logging in easy-to-use.
New features are great, new green is an eyesore
New app is awesome Totally kills the old interface, thanks!

Why the need for a feed? Do not like being forced to have a feed. I would like to have it blank with it not suggesting that I pick something to fill the feed with... Otherwise I find the app very easy to maneuver and helpful

Issues Building in background photo flickers
Home page background picture vibrates The new android app update just came out and most things seem to work fine, but the home page has a background picture of NY City that vibrates incessantly (probably a bug of some sort) which is very annoying.
Needs lots of polishing So you decided to use Material Design... great! But you need to complete your job. The Log-in screen is still from 2010 era). Use icons provided by Google, use Roboto font (check out TDA Trader app). Please give us "dark theme". Toggle buttons should be green, not blue... to match the main theme.

Feed feature bug It's a good thing I'm not epileptic because the new feed background is continuously trying to redraw. It seems like this should have been caught in QA. Moto x Pure, stock rom, marshmallow
The new version is bad. Don't update! Too much wasted space and 'fun' graphics. The designers probably enjoy their new toy, but I don't. Not as useful as the last version. Columns, rows and text are so big you can only see a portion of the data you need. How can I get the last version back?
Fidelity mobile Can easily see Empire State Building in person. How to make app go directly to account details? After all, this is my retirement account, not picture book.
Old app was visually and functionally better I liked the old, larger, bold font, better. Can't make alert on top telling me markets are closed for memorial day go away. I should be able to x it out and regain the space immediately. Empire State building is superfluous, another user said it already, this isn't supposed to be a pretty travel app. Wonder how much money was wasted on something that already worked perfectly. Disappointed.

New version is a piece of crap, the previous version is alot better.
Isn't worth it. Use the internet. New update is like a polished turd. No way to go straight to account info. I don't need a feed. Just because it looks nice doesn't make it good.
Still no charts for mutual funds. Worthless for my 401K. Bring back charts for mutual funds. I can't belive I can't see a chart. After 30 years I may just switch. What type of investor doesn't look at charts?

Terrible update! Background graphic oscillating like a cheap fluorescent light. Don't rush out software before it's tested for the most basic behavior.
New update not working App background is flashing like it's trying to give me a seizure. Please fix. Nexus 6P on Android 6.0.1
The version is bad Unfortunately this is a tool not a game. Screens are too busy, Bo need to all background pictures. Everything was made so fancy but without the customer/user in mind. Where are the commodities, Treasury interest rates etc? Screens are way too busy. The news are spread I two dimensions. In summary I do not like the latest revision Fidelity needs to roll it back
