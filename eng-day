Your opinion would be valuable, Tony, How do you feel about this?
I am sorry, what do you mean by a small problem?
I don't understand. Can you be a little more specific?
John, can we just go over your objections again?
Raise your hand.
What other ways are there to approach this?
What's your view on that, Carlos?
What's your reaction to this, Neela?
So, can I just summarize what we've discussed so far?
Thanks for your reminder/co-operation/time.
