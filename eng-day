After Jimmy Frank and Harold left for college...We were inseparable.
Tommy always walked in the front,...I walked behind Phil. ... Since I was the youngest brother, I always brought up the rear.
When Momma would get tired of us, she'd load us up in our Ford Falcon and drive to Belcher...She'd drop us off at the Red River levee,
and say, "Go catch us a mess of fish, I don't want to see y'all until suppert time".
Basically, Mom was letting us know that she was tired of us and needed a day off.
If I spend most of my adult life around five boys, I'd need a vacation every once in a while.

Your opinion would be valuable, Tony, How do you feel about this?
I am sorry, what do you mean by a small problem?
I don't understand. Can you be a little more specific?
John, can we just go over your objections again?
Raise your hand.
What other ways are there to approach this?
What's your view on that, Carlos?
What's your reaction to this, Neela?
So, can I just summarize what we've discussed so far?
Thanks for your reminder/co-operation/time.
